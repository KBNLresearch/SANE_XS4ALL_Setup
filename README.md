# SANE XS4ALL Software Lists

This repository contains files that define which software packages are available in KB's XS4ALL SANE environment.

Use this repo to track and update the set of accessible software and packages for the XS4ALL configuration.

The script will install (see/edit top lines of [script](install_solrwayback.ps1) for version numbers of each):

    - Java 11
    - Tomcat 9
    - Solr 9

## Python packages

Our list of installed [python packages](requirements.txt) is based on the [default list of python packages in SANE](https://gitlab.com/rsc-surf-nl/co-create-plugins/sane-tinker-python-packages/-/raw/main/requirements.txt). However, we have disabled all packages used exclusively for Deep Learning, as we currently do not allow this application with our dataset.
